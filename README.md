# Palindrome checking
## Following are the steps to check whether a given number or string is Palindrome:
1) Get the string or number from the user.
2) Use a temporary variable to store the given string or number.
3) Reverse the string or number.
4) Comparethe original string/number with the reversed string/number
5) If both are the same, then the string/number is a Palindrome.
6) Else it is not a Palindrome.

### Palindrome checking in JavaScript using built-in Functions:
1) The split() method converts the string into individual array characters.
2) The reverse() method reverses the position in an array.
3) The join() method joins all the elements of the array into a string.
4) if...else.. statement can be used to check if the string and the reversed string are equal.
